# User-Funnel 

This flow represents the progressive steps a user follows, from installing the app to becoming a cardholder with full access.
Additionally, we analyzed the transactions performed at each stage to better understand user behavior and optimize the experience.

## 1. Install App
The user downloads and installs the app on their device.

## 2. Account Registration
The user registers on the platform by providing the required details (email, name, etc.).

## 3. Application Submission
After registration, the user submits an application to obtain the card.

## 4. Approval
The application is reviewed and approved by the entity.

## 5. Card Linking
The card (either physical or digital) is linked to the userâ€™s account.

## 6. Cardholder (Full Access)
The user becomes a cardholder when both the physical and digital cards are linked to their account.

# Summary:
The user funnel provides a clear view of our users' behavior, helping us identify at which stages users drop off and how many are affected as they progress through each phase of the funnel. This analysis is key for understanding user behavior and making strategic decisions to optimize conversion
